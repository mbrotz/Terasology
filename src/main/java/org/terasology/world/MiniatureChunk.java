 * Chunks are the basic components of the world. Each chunk contains a fixed amount of blocks
 * determined by its dimensions. They are used to manage the world efficiently and
 * to reduce the batch count within the render loop.
 * <p/>
 * Chunks are tessellated on creation and saved to vertex arrays. From those VBOs are generated
 * which are then used for the actual rendering process.
